The server shall then project the ball near vertically upwards, without imparting spin, so that it rises at least 16 cm after leaving the palm of the free hand and then falls without touching anything before being struck. As the ball is falling the server shall strike it so that it touches first his or her court and then, after passing over or around the net assembly, touches directly the receiver's court; in doubles, the ball shall touch successively the right half court of server and receiver. From the start of service until it is struck, the ball shall be above the level of the playing surface and behind the server's end line, and it shall not be hidden from the receiver by the server or his or her doubles partner or by anything they wear or carry. As soon as the ball has been projected, the server’s free arm and hand shall be removed from the space between the ball and the net.</p>\n<p>The space between the ball and the net is defined by the ball, the net and its indefinite upward extension. It is the responsibility of the player to serve so that the umpire or the assistant umpire can be satisfied that he or she complies with the requirements of the Laws, and either may decide that a service is incorrect. If either the umpire or the assistant umpire is not sure about the legality of a service he or she may, on the first occasion in a match, interrupt play and warn the server; but any subsequent service by that player or his or her doubles partner which is not clearly legal shall be considered incorrect. Exceptionally, the umpire may relax the requirements for a correct service where he or she is satisfied that compliance is prevented by physical disability.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-return-\">The Return:</h2>\n<p>The ball, having been served or returned shall be struck so that it passes over or around the net assembly and touches the opponent's court, either directly or after touching the net assembly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-order-of-play-\">The Order of Play:</h2>\n<p>In singles the server shall make a first service and the receiver shall make a return and thereafter alternately shall each make a return In doubles the server shall first make a service, the receiver shall then make a return, the partner of the server shall then make a return, the partner of the receiver shall then make a return and there after each player in turn in that sequence shall make a return.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-point-\">A Point—</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Unless the rally is a let, a player shall score a point If an opponent fails to make a correct service;</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If an opponent fails to make a correct return;</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If, after he or she has made a service or a return, the ball touches anything other than the net assembly before being struck by an opponent;</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>if the ball passes over his or her court or beyond his or her end line without touching his or her court, after being struck by an opponent;</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If an opponent obstructs the ball;</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If an opponent deliberately strikes the ball twice in succession;</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If an opponent, or anything an opponent wears or carries, moves the playing surface; If an opponent, or anything an opponent wears or carries, touches the net assembly;</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If an opponent's free hand touches the playing surface;</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If a doubles opponent strikes the ball out of the sequence established by the first server and  first receiver;</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"a-game-\">A Game -</h2>\n<p>A game shall be won by a player or pair first scoring 11 points unless both players or pairs score 10 points, when the games shall be won by the first player or pair subsequently gaining a lead of 2 points.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-match-\">A Match -</h2>\n<p>A match shall consist of the best of 5 for the league round and best of 7 for playoffs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"appeals-\">Appeals -</h2>\n<p>No agreement between players, in an individual event, or between team captains, in a team event, can alter a decision on a question of fact by the responsible match official, on a question of interpretation of Laws or Regulations by the responsible referee or on any other question of tournament or match conduct by the responsible management committee.</p>\n<p>No appeal may be made to the referee against a decision on a question of fact by the responsible match official or to the management committee on a question of interpretation of Laws or Regulations by the referee.</p>\n<p>An appeal may be made to the referee against a decision of a match official on a question of interpretation of Laws or Regulations, and the decision of the referee shall be final.</p>\n<h2 id=\"practice-\">Practice-</h2>\n<p>Players are entitled to practice on the match table for up to 2 minutes immediately before the start of a match but not during normal intervals; the specified practice period may be extended only with the permission of the referee.</p>\n<h2 id=\"intervals-\">Intervals-</h2>\n<p>An interval of up to 1 minute between successive games of an individual match</p>\n<p>Brief intervals for toweling after every 6 points from the start of each game and at the change of ends in the last possible game of an individual match.</p>\n<p>A player or pair may claim one time-out period of up to 1 minute during an individual match.</p>\n<p>The request for a time-out, which can be made only between rallies in a game, shall be indicated by making a \"T\" sign with the hands.</p>\n",
